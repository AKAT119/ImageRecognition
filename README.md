# ImageRecognition

using TensorFlow, Keras, Mobilenet to recognize images.


Usage

To use the image recognition system:

Run the ImageRecognition.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
The notebook demonstrates various methods to load and display an image (using IPython, Keras, and cv2).
It then processes the image and uses a pre-trained MobileNet model for recognition.

How it Works

The system loads an image and preprocesses it to the required format.
MobileNet, a pre-trained deep learning model, is used to recognize the content of the image.
The notebook includes steps for image preprocessing, model loading, prediction, and result interpretation.


Model Details

MobileNet is utilized for its efficiency and accuracy in image recognition tasks.
The model is pre-trained with ImageNet weights for a broad range of object categories.
